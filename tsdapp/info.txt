As a senior React engineer, my recommended way to organize this code would be to separate the different concerns 
into different components and files. This would help to make the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.


One approach would be to have the following components:

components
    TicTacToeGame: This would be the main component that would hold the state of the game and handle user interactions. 
                It would render other components such as GameInfo, Board, and CreateJoinGame based on the game state.

    GameInfo: This would display information about the game such as the game ID, players, and current player.

    Board: This would display the game board and handle user clicks on cells.

    CreateJoinGame: This would allow users to create or join a game.

    In addition to these components, I would also create the following hooks and context:

context
    TicTacToeContext: This would hold the state of the Tic Tac Toe game and expose methods to update it. 
                        It would be used by the TicTacToeGame component.

hooks

    useContract: This would provide access to the TicTacToeContract instance. It would be used by the TicTacToeGame component.

    useGameInfo: This would provide access to the game information such as players, current player, and board. It would be used by the 
                GameInfo component.

    useBoard: This would provide access to the game board and handle user clicks on cells. It would be used by the Board component.

    useCreateJoinGame: This would provide methods to create or join a game. It would be used by the CreateJoinGame component.


The file structure for this approach could look like this:

components
    TicTacToeGame.tsx
    GameInfo.tsx
    Board.tsx
    CreateJoinGame.tsx
hooks
    useContract.ts
    useGameInfo.ts
    useBoard.ts
    useCreateJoinGame.ts
context
    TicTacToeContext.ts
utils
    provider.ts

The TicTacToeGame component would use the hooks and context to handle the game logic and render the other components. 
The other components would be responsible for rendering the relevant UI based on their props.

Overall, this approach would make the code easier to understand and maintain by separating concerns and following 
best practices for React development.
